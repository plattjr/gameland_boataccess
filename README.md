## NCWRC Game Land and Boat Access

#### *About The Map*

For this map I am looking at the number of public boating access points owned by the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission and how many are on each game land type.

I will for sure be coming back to this map to try and get my choropleth feature to work properly.
